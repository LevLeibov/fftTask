###### FFt test
1. In *SplitRadix.py* comparison of built in numpy *fft* and split radix *fft* is presented.
2. In *SplitRadixWithError.py* the dependence of NMSE of split radix *fft* with error on the number of layer 
is computed for different standard deviations of Gaussian distributions of error. 
Note: now all the analysis is presented in the google docks file accessible by https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ruvrYftgAMNSGtRNMF21pq_GBoASd_-ipYt4lPVgefc/edit
